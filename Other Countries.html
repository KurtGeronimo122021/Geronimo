<h4> Taipei, Taiwan </h4><br>
</font>
<pre>
		Taipei is a foodie’s dream. There are Michelin-star restaurants, 
hole-in-the-wall eateries and street food 24 hours a day, each with delicious delicacies to offer. 
Start your day with pineapple cakes and oolong tea and work your way toward beef noodle soup and 
black pepper buns. Or head into one of the shrimping bars on Zhìshàn Road, where you literally catch your 
own dinner.
		Of course, you have to do something other than just eat, and Taipei
excels at that, too. Hit up the city museums and temples, do some shopping or day trip to Beitou for hot 
springs and hiking.

<h4> Valdez, Alaska </h4><br>
</font>
<pre>
		Valdez offers an incredible microcosm of all that Alaska has to offer:
glaciers, fjord cruises, salmon and halibut fishing, sea kayaking, hiking and wildlife-watching. It’s 
also a photographer’s dream. The drive-in on the Richardson Highway will leave you gaping at the scenery.
		Since this small city isn’t on most first-timers’ radar, it’s not 
terribly busy even in peak season, but services are limited and you’ll need to make reservations in 
advance for hotels and tours. When you do, allow some flexibility for bad weather. Valdez gets a lot of rain 
and snow, which keeps waterfalls looking spectacular all year long.

<h4> Walt Disney World, Florida </h4><br>
</font>
<pre>
		Disney’s 50th-anniversary festivities begin October 1, 2021 and
are expected to last 18 months, giving you plenty of time to join the party. Specific celebrations 
haven’t been announced yet, but you can expect magical entertainment, specially-themed souvenirs 
and treats and new park decor.
		Waiting until 2022 for the initial crowds to lessen may actually 
be in your favor, especially since some favorite festivities like fireworks and parades are currently
paused. Holding out for smaller crowds may also speed up your wait time on new rides like Remy’s 
Ratatouille Adventure at EPCOT.

<h4> Cairo, Egypt </h4><br>
</font>
<pre>
		After numerous delays, this is finally the year the Grand Egyptian
Museum is scheduled to open. The new museum will sit just outside the infamous Pyramids of Giza and, 
unlike the former Egyptian Museum downtown, it will be a gorgeous, modern look at Egypt’s past.
		With brand new exhibits and never-seen-before artifacts from recent 
discoveries in Saqqara and Luxor, this museum will be worth the trip even if you’ve previously 
visited Egypt. Like all world-class museums, expect to spend a full day (or more) taking in all the exhibits.

<h4> Bristol, England </h4><br>
</font>
<pre>
		Banksy fans may already be aware of what a great destination Bristol
is—the street art is phenomenal—but it’s time for the rest of the world to catch on. Due west from London,
Bristol is a mid-sized city with a spirited identity and lively atmosphere.
		Narrowing down what to do can be difficult, but visitors should include
touring Brunel’s SS Great Britain and the flagship M Shed museum to start. Netflix Bridgerton fans can day
-trip to Bath fifteen minutes away to see filming sites in person.

<h4> British Virgin Islands </h4><br>
</font>
<pre>
		Hurricane Irma wreaked havoc on the BVI in 2017, leaving devastating 
damage in its path that took years to recover. Finally, the British Virgin Islands have rebuilt and reopened
with enough infrastructure available that tourists can return and expect most of their favorites to be open.
		Choosing which island to stay on can feel overwhelming, but there’s
no bad choice. Pick one and stop stressing: You can visit others via day trip thanks to ferries and charter 
boats. If you truly can’t decide, you can always book a catamaran to sleep on instead of a resort so that your
“hotel” room moves with you.
