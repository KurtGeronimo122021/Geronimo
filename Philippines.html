<h4> Palawan for Beaches </h4><br>
</font>
<pre>
		One of the most popular reasons to visit the Philippines is the amazing beaches,
	and if you only have time for one beach area, make it Palawan. This is where some of the very best 
	beaches in the country are located, and there are lots of luxury resorts to choose from to make your 
	stay comfortable. Most travelers fly into Puerto Princesa Airport to get here, and Palawan is accessible 
	by plane from Manila, Cebu, and Iloilo. Its white-sand beaches, lagoons, cliffs, and scenery won’t disappoint you.

		There are plenty of places for outdoor adventure in the Philippines,
	but one of the best places to go to get your adrenaline rush is Quirino. 
	This is a less touristy area in the Philippines that is a favorite among active 
	adventurers who love to explore mountains, caves, and rivers. This is a great place 
	to go for spelunking, mountain biking, hiking, and kayaking on the Cagayan River. 
	Another fun area is the Governor’s Rapids in Maddela, which is a top spot for whitewater rafting.

<h4> Manila </h4><br>

		Manila is the capital of the Philippines and the best place to learn
		about the nation’s history and culture over the years. The National Museum
		of the Philippines is a great place to start, while other top attractions
		in Manila give a background to the city’s history. Learn about the walled city 
		of Intramuros, where Fort Santiago, San Agustin Church, Manila Cathedral, and 
		Plaza de Roma are located. Make sure to check out Rizal Park, which is a very
		famous park that has an iconic monument and the country’s tallest flag.
