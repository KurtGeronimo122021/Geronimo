<h4> Cape Town </h4><br>
</font>
<pre>
		Cape Town, South Africa is one of the planet's most breathtaking cities. 
Nature surrounds this multicultural city, which nuzzles between a rugged range of mountains and the sea.
		One of the top things to do in Cape Town is visit Table Mountain, the 
flat-topped peak presiding over the city. For a spectacular overview, hike to the summit, or glide up 
on the cableway. The hour-long hike up Lion's Head also provides panoramic city vistas.
		On Table Mountain's eastern slopes, the magnificent Kirstenbosch Botanical 
Gardens lie within a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
		Cape Town's coast is also full of natural wonders. Strolling along the waterfront 
boardwalk, you might see whales spouting from the harbor. Penguins waddle along the golden beaches
in False Bay, and south of the city, Cape Point is home to abundant wildlife and diverse botanical beauty.
		Cape Town is also known for its beautiful boulder-flanked beaches. Camp's 
Bay is a favorite, with plenty of chic shops and caf√©s nearby.
		Cape Town residents love their coast so much that at sunset, they stake a spot
along spectacular Chapman's Peak Drive to toast the sunset in a dusk ritual known as "sundowners."
Celebrating nature's beauty in this way is one of the unique things to do in South Africa, and 
something you might encounter on your travels at various locations around the country.
		Another one of Cape Town's top attractions is the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront, 
reminiscent of Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco. Here, you can shop, dine, and enjoy the 
many entertainment venues, including Two Ocean's Aquarium.

<h4> The Drakensberg, KwaZulu-Natal </h4><br>
</font>
<pre>
	The spectacular Drakensberg, meaning "Dragon Mountains," is one of the top places
to visit in KwaZulu-Natal and a popular vacation destination for South Africans. It's also home to the
country's highest peaks.
	The region encompasses the World Heritage-listed uKhahlamba-Drakensberg Park, a 
region of jaw-dropping beauty, with jagged basalt buttresses and San rock art, and Royal Natal 
National Park, home to the awe-inspiring Amphitheatre, a magnificent cliff face and source of South 
Africa's main rivers.
	The Giant's Castle Game Reserve in the region protects large herds of eland. 
Dense forests flourish in the sheltered valleys, and the area is home to more than 800 different 
species of flowering plants, as well as a rich diversity of wildlife.
	In the summer, the mountain landscapes are lush and fertile, with gushing 
waterfalls and crystal-clear streams. In the winter, snow cloaks the dramatic peaks.
	Visitors flock here to hike and bike the scenic mountain trails, fish for
trout, rock climb, abseil, parasail, and raft the waters of the fast-flowing rivers. Hot air 
balloon rides are a great way to appreciate the dramatic topography.

<h4> Kruger National Park, Mpumalanga and Limpopo Provinces </h4><br>
</font>
<pre>
	Kruger National Park is one of the best game reserves in Africa, and one
of the oldest in South Africa. If you're a wildlife lover, this famous park definitely needs
to be on your South Africa itinerary.
	The park lies about a 3.5- to 4.5-hour drive from Johannesburg and offers
visitors the chance to see the "Big Five": lion, leopard, buffalo, elephant, and rhino, as 
well as an astounding diversity of other wildlife. It's also home to San (bushman) rock 
paintings and archaeological sites.
	You can explore Kruger National Park on the large network of sealed roads;
organize a walking safari; or soar over the vast grasslands, gallery forests, and river
systems in a hot air balloon.
