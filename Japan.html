<h4> Kyoto </h4><br>
</font>
<pre>
		If you only have time for one Japan destination, make it Kyoto.
		This is traditional Japan as you imagined it—geisha in brightly coloured kimonos 
		emerging from wooden teahouses, forests of bamboo, temples and shrines in gold and 
		silver and scarlet, raked gravel Zen gardens, intricate feasts served on lacquered 
		plates, graceful tea ceremonies, and markets full of intriguing but unidentifiable 
		ingredients.
		
		The concrete high-rises of downtown Kyoto can be disappointing,
		so head out towards the mountains to the surrounding neighbourhoods where you’ll find 
		narrow stone streets, old wooden houses, monks in flowing robes, and the sounds of 
		chanting and gongs from the many temples and shrines.
		
		Kyoto is one of the top Japan tourist spots, so try to visit the 
		popular temples early in the morning as they do get crowded.

<h4> Tokyo </h4><br>
</font>
<pre>
		If Kyoto is the heart of traditional Japan, Tokyo is its ultramodern
		counterpart. It’s here you’ll find the skyscrapers, noisy arcades, busy pedestrian 
		crossings, crazy youth fashions, and many many incredibly delicious restaurants. If all 
		you do in Tokyo is eat, you’ll have an amazing time—even as vegetarians we ate so well.
		
		Tokyo is also home to some of the weirdest activities they have ever done.
		From themed cafes (cats, owls, maids, robots, goats—you name it, Tokyo has it) to 
		sensory-overload shows and arcades to cos-play go-karting.

<h4> Kawaguchiko </h4><br>
</font>
<pre>
		For the best views of Mount Fuji, head to Lake Kawaguchiko.
		It’s especially lovely in cherry blossom or autumn leaf seasons.
