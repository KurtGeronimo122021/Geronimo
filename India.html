<h4> Agra </h4><br>
</font>
<pre>
		Agra is home to India's most iconic attraction the Taj Mahal and 
a part of the famous Golden Triangle route, making it one of the most visited cities
in India. The magnificent Taj Mahal, built by the fifth emperor of the Mughal Empire
Shah Jahan as a memorial to his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, is considered to be the 
symbol of love and is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. Every year, millions
of visitors come to admire this beautiful mausoleum and listen to the fascinating story
behind it. Famous visitors include Princess Diana, Hillary Clinton, and Mark Zuckerberg.

		As the formal capital city of the Mughal Empire, Agra has other
interesting sites that are worth visiting, such as Agra Fort, one of the finest Mughal 
forts, and the Tomb of Itimad-Ud-Daulah which is often called the Baby Taj. It is also 
highly recommended that you take a side trip to Fatehpur Sikri, the short-lived capital
of the Mughal Empire, where you'll find some of the finest examples of Mughal architecture.

		Also, the best time to visit Agra is October to March. And the
best time of the day to visit the Taj Mahal is either at sunrise or sunset.

<h4> Amritsar </h4><br>
</font>
<pre>
		Situated in India's Northwest frontier with Pakistan, Amritsar
offers a distinctive travel experience. Here almost half of the locals are Sikhs who believe
in equality regardless of race, religion, caste, and gender. (The word "Sikh" actually means
"learner" or "seeker of truth" and Sikhism is the world's fifth-largest religion.) The city
of Amritsar, founded in 1577 by the fourth Sikh guru, is the holiest city for the Sikhs and home
to the majestic Golden Temple (Sri Harmandir Sahib, "The Abode of God"), the central place 
of worship for all Sikhs. The temple welcomes visitors of all religions and attracts pilgrims 
from all over the world.

		The dome is covered in gold and the temple has entrances on all
four sides, symbolizing openness. When lit up at night, the temple looks spectacular, with its
gold dome illuminated. So the evening is a great time to admire its beauty and charm. Apart from
its striking appearance, the Golden Temple is known for having the largest free community kitchen 
in the world, offering free vegetarian meals to up to 100,000 visitors daily. It's possible to 
tour the kitchen and even volunteer to prepare and serve food there.
