<h4> The Oslo Region </h4><br>
</font>
<pre>
		A lot of things are cooking in the Norwegian capital, 
		which was named European Green Capital 2019. A cutting-edge food scene, 
		new and funky neighbourhoods, a fully-packed event calendar, and several 
		brand-new museums and attractions are just a few teasers of what you can
		expect. Surrounded by the Oslofjord and dense forests, you can easily 
		combine urban city life with nature-based fun like cycling, skiing, and 
		island hopping. In the nearby regions of Østfold and Vestfold, charming 
		towns such as Fredrikstad and Tønsberg are dotted along the coast. About 
		an hour’s drive from Oslo lies Norway’s new art destination Hadeland
		where you can visit the Kistefos-Museet with the spectacular exhibition 
		building The Twist.

<h4> The Svalbard Islands </h4><br>
</font>
<pre>
		The Svalbard Islands lie in the middle of the Arctic Ocean,
		halfway between Norway and the North Pole. Here, you can participate in 
		exotic nature-based activities all year round in a landscape that is both
		rugged and fragile. Try your hand at dog sledging, go ice caving, join a 
		snowmobile safari, or hunt for the northern lights. In addition to a few
		thousand polar bears, the islands are home to almost 3,000 humans. The main 
		city of Longyearbyen is a colourful mini metropole that offers a wide range 
		of cultural activities and high-quality places to eat and drink that you 
		usually would expect to find only in big cities.

<h4> Tromsø and the land of the northern lights </h4><br>
</font>
<pre>
		The capital of the Arctic, Tromsø, is located right in
		the middle of Northern Norway. If your bucket list includes northern lights,
		whale watching, midnight sun, and epic nature adventures, this is where you 
		want to go. Enjoy superb conditions for ski touring and hiking in the 
		Lyngenfjord region, experience the Sami culture in towns like Karasjok and Alta,
		and enter the northernmost point of Europe at the North Cape. In the eastern 
		part of this vast region, you’ll find the Varanger peninsula, which is a bird 
		watcher’s paradise. Go king crab fishing and dog sledging in Kirkenes, where 
		you also can spend a night at an ice hotel. In the areas surrounding Tromsø, 
		several islands are waiting to be explored, including Senja, Kvaløya, and Sommarøy.
