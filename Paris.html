<h4> Eiffel Tower </h4><br>
</font>
<pre>
		The Eiffel Tower (la Tour Eiffel) ranks high on the list of places
to visit in France and is the most-visited tourist attraction in the world. It's hard to
believe that the structure was dismissed as a monstrosity when it was first unveiled.

		For first-time visitors, seeing the Eiffel Tower is an unforgettable
experience. Upon arrival at the esplanade (where the Information Desk is located), the sight
of the four massive pillars that support this 10,100-ton monument leaves many awestruck.

		Tourists will want to spend some time snapping photos of Paris' most
emblematic monument. From either the Jardins du Trocadéro (a short walk across the Seine River)
or the Parc du Champ de Mars (the lawns in front of the tower), there is just the right distance
for picture-perfect photo-ops.

<h4> Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Paris </h4><br>
</font>
<pre>
		Notre-Dame stands in the heart of Paris on the Île-de-la-Cité next 
to the Latin Quarter. An island in the Seine River, the Île-de-la-Cité is the historical and 
geographical center of Paris. On this small plot of land, the Romans built the Gallo-Roman city of
Lutetia, and from the 6th century to the 14th century, the Kings of France resided here.

		The Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Paris was founded in 1163 by King Louis
IX (Saint Louis) and Bishop Maurice de Sully, and the construction took more than 150 years.
The cathedral was first created in Early Gothic style, while later additions (the west front 
and the nave) show the transition to High Gothic style.

		This impressive medieval monument is a triumph of Gothic architecture.
Tourists are immediately struck by the ornamental design of the facade, with its profusion of
sculptures and gargoyles, while elaborate flying buttresses provide structural integrity for
the enormous building.

		Visitors should take a close look at the Gallery of Kings above the
doorway on the elaborately detailed west facade. Rows of 28 intricately carved figures reveal
representations of the French kings, from Childebert I (511-588) to Philippe Auguste. These
figures lost their heads during the Revolution. (The heads are now on display in the Musée de Cluny.)

<h4> Arc de Triomphe </h4><br>
</font>
<pre>
		The Arc de Triomphe is dedicated to the soldiers who fought in the
French armies of the Revolution and the First Empire (Napoleonic Wars). Napoleon commissioned the
building of this mighty structure in 1806 but did not live to see its completion in 1836.

		Designed by architect Jean François Chalgrin, who was inspired by the
Arch of Titus in Rome, the massive 50-meter-high arch features bas-reliefs with larger-than-life-size
figures, which depict the departure, victories, and glorious return of the French armies.

		Particularly noteworthy is the bas-relief by François Rude on the
Champs-Elysées-facing side: Departure of the Volunteers of 1792, also known as The Marseillaise,
illustrating the troops led by the winged spirit of Liberty. On the inner surface of the arch are the 
names of more than 660 generals and more than a hundred battles.

		From the top of the monument, a viewing platform affords panoramic 
views of the 12 avenues that radiate from the Place de l'Etoile, including the route from the
Champs-Elysées to Place de la Concorde and the Louvre. It's possible to see all the way to La Défense,
Montmartre, and the Eiffel Tower.

		At the foot of the Arc de Triomphe is the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier,
dedicated in 1921 as a memorial to an anonymous soldier (symbol of the many other unknown soldiers who
valiantly died for their country during World War One without ever receiving recognition).

		The monument staff provides guided tours in French every day at 10:30am;
these tours are included in the price of the admission ticket. The site also has documentation and 
multi-media presentations in multiple languages.

		Tourists will appreciate the gift shop and bookstore at the Arc de Triomphe.
For visitors with reduced mobility and young children, there is an elevator to reach the viewing
platform. Otherwise, visitors must take the stairs.
